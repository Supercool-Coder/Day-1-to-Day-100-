# Day-1-to-Day-100-
Choose a Programming Language and Learn The Fundamentals of it   

1. C++ Language 
2. Java Language 
3. Python Language

You need to choose a programming language and you need to be stick with it. Explore various programming languages, read about them, try it out in your code editor, and check if you’re comfortable with it or not. 

A lot of questions will arise when you will be choosing a language. Is Python better than Java? C++ is a faster language, so I should choose this language, Java syntax is more complicated but big companies are working on it, what if I know more than one language? 

All these questions will create confusion and you will also switch to some different languages when you will try the languages in your code editor. Explore the languages and pick one which is best for you. Don’t choose a language just because it is very popular in the tech industry. You need to choose a language you’re most comfortable with. Almost it will take 4-5 days in picking up a language.

Once you choose a language learn the fundamentals of it but if you already know the fundamentals (you might have created your project in that language) then brush up on it. It has been seen that a lot of people forget the basic things of their chosen language. So you need to make sure that you have a good command of your chosen language. Learn the basic syntax, give some online tests, and remember the basic things of your chosen language. It may take around one week or 7 days to learn the fundamentals of your language. 

Few things you should remember are…

Reading/Writing from/to files.
Reading input from the console.
Split strings
2D array implementation and how to use it.
Very basics things of language such as in C/C++ handling null-terminated strings
A lot of companies such as Lyft and Salesforce have a slight difference in their hiring procedure. They want the candidate to write code and solve the problems on a laptop. You will have to write the complete program and your code should pass the given test cases. You may have to work on command line arguments or you may have to parse the CSV or text files. 

Other companies such as Google, Amazon, or Microsoft use a whiteboard. So it’s good that you know the basics of your language to handle both of the coding scenarios in your interview. So almost it will take 10 days to make a decision that which language is best for you and you’re comfortable with.
